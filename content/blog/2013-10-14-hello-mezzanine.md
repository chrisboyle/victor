Out with the old, in with the new.

<!--more-->

This site is now a more maintainable [Mezzanine](http://mezzanine.jupo.org/) instance instead of my [Rails 2.x CMS](https://chris.boyle.name/projects/cbn). All posts and comments before here are imports.

**Update 2021:** I've [migrated again](/blog/2021/04/hello-hugo).
