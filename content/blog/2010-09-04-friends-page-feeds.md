LiveJournal and other sites using the same software don't provide a feed of your friends/reading page, something that has irritated me since I signed up.

As more of your friends migrate to Dreamwidth or elsewhere (here's the [latest reason](https://thequestionclub.livejournal.com/86168785.html)) and more people thus suddenly want to keep up with multiple LJ-like sites, I'm guessing this will be an increasingly common irritation. These sites provide feeds of individual friends, but when you're reading a couple of hundred (making your feed reader's update cycle take forever), and/or you frequently edit the list, this is not ideal.

In late 2008 I thought well, why don't I just put a feed merger on a cron job? and so I did. I've been using it since then, and have finally got around to tidying it up and releasing it. On the [project page](/projects/amaljamate/), you'll find the script and instructions. It's by no means a complete or universal solution: you need to have your own web hosting and be able to set up authentication. Still, a few people have kept asking me for this, so for them at least, here it is: [Amaljamate](/projects/amaljamate).
