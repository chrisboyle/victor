I am the current maintainer of the packages listed below.

As well as writing bash scripts, this involves working with code from upstream authors to ensure it installs and runs smoothly on Debian systems and is sufficiently well documented. It also involves passing on bug reports from Debian users and helping with the fixes where possible.

- [aewm++](https://packages.debian.org/src:aewm++) and [aewm++-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/src:aewm++): A minimalist window manager written in C++ and some companion utilities.
- [crack-attack](https://packages.debian.org/src:crack-attack): A multiplayer OpenGL puzzle game.
- [sapphire](https://packages.debian.org/src:sapphire): Another minimalist window manager, from the same author as aewm++.

[klogic](https://packages.debian.org/src:klogic) was a [KDE](https://kde.org/) digital logic simulator, removed with KDE 3 (no KDE 4 port).
