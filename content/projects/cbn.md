CBN was a previous version of this website. It was a Rails app of my own invention, written because I wanted the blog to be on my own server, the login and comments features to be just so, my web development experience to be a bit more recent, and PHP to not even be installed.

I also made a previous attempt some years before in Python (CherryPy, SQLAlchemy, Genshi) but found Rails and its plugins to be, at the time, a much more complete and well-integrated toolkit that made the whole development process easier and quicker.

Features included OpenID/Facebook/Twitter login, a blog, comments (with threading and moderation), a project list, static pages and some microformat support. The name just stands for chris.boyle.name, the site for which it was written. Icons (except for other sites' favicons) were from the [famfamfam "Silk" set](http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/).

I retired the project in 2013 due to lack of time to maintain it. It was replaced with a [Mezzanine](http://mezzanine.jupo.org/) instance, and then in 2021 with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
