An Android application to sound alarms at regular intervals, optionally waiting for each alarm to be acknowledged before starting the timer for the next. This is useful for people who need to take tablets N hours apart, for example.

I don't consider this reliable enough for widespread use, so it's not on Google Play. See [GitHub](http://github.com/chrisboyle/timer) for source/changes.

A previous incarnation of this project existed from May 2007 for PalmOS, but was abandoned when PalmOS itself stopped being supported.
